## üìñ Project Summary
Carder Flashcards is a simple desktop studying app that allows users to create, study, edit, and delete flashcard sets locally. Users can study their flashcards in various ways to improve memory retention, including:
- **Non-tracking mode**: Sequentially move through flashcard sets
- **Tracking mode**: Sort cards into "unknown" and "known" categories and studies unknown terms
- **Shuffle mode**: Randomly orders the flashcards for varied studying.

I developed this project to address the issues and bugs I encountered using [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com). The application is entirely built in Java using [Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)) for its UI and [Maven][maven] as a build tool. All necessary [dependencies][gh-dependencies] are included in the `pom.xml` file.

## üìù Usage Guide

### Creating Sets:
1. From the home screen, click the `+ new set` button located at the bottom. You will be moved to the creation screen
2. Fill in the title, description, as well as card fields
3. To add a card, press `+ card`
4. To delete a specific card, press the `x` button to the right of it
5. Any invalid inputs (i.e., empty) will cause an error message to display, outlining why creation has failed
6. Once all inputs all valid (i.e., non-empty), you can press either `create` or `create + study` to create the set. Pressing `create` will bring you back to the home screen, while `create + study` lets you study your newly created set

### Studying Sets:
1. From the home screen, press the `study` button for a specific set or, while in the creation screen, press `create + study` to study (both shown below). You will then be moved to the studying screen.

<p align="center">OR</p>

<p align="center">
    <img style="width:80%" src="./images/carder-create-and-study-button.png" alt="study screen create and study button">
</p>

2. In the non-tracking (default) study mode, use the `prev` and `next` buttons to move through the set. When the end of your set is reached, you will be asked to go back or fully restart.

</p>

3. In the tracking study mode, use the `unknown` and `known` buttons to sort your cards. When the end of your set is reached, you will be asked to go back, study your unknown cards, or fully restart.

### Editing Sets:
1. To edit a set, press the `edit` button to the left of it. This will bring you to the edit screen

<p align="center">
    <img style="width:85%" src="./images/carder-editing-button.png" alt="the edit button on the home screen">
</p>

2. In the edit screen, you can freely edit the title, description, and cards. The same logic for adding and removing cards applies
3. If any edits are invalid (i.e., empty) and you press `done`, an error message will display, outlining what must be corrected

<p align="center">
    <img style="width:60%" src="./images/carder-edit-done-button.png" alt="the done button in the edit screen">
</p>

4. Once all edits are valid, you can press `done` to overwrite your previous set. You will then be brought to the home screen, where your edits will be readily apparent

**NOTE**: If you leave to the home screen or exit the app before publishing edits, they will not be saved.

### Deleting Sets:
1. To delete a set, simply press the `delete` button on the home screen. You will be prompted to confirm this deletion. Deletions are irreversible
