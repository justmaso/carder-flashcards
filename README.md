## Features of The Software:
When creating a set, the user inputs the front and back text for each flashcard. After creating a flashcard set, the program allows the user to study from them in the creation order or random order. Users can simply cycle through the cards or sort them into a “known” or “not known” category when studying. Only flashcards in the “not known” category will be cycled through (if in sorting mode) when finished studying an entire set. Additionally, while studying from created sets, the user can have the program speak the front text and/or the back text (either automatically or manually) for enhanced accessibility. Users can also edit created sets to add/remove cards or fix typos. Lastly, when users are finished studying from a set, they can restart and study from the same set, or exit the “study” mode and create more flashcards sets.

## Installation instructions:
This program can be installed by cloning the repository and opening it in a java IDE (e.g, IntelliJ). 
- Version: Java 22
